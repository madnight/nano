          Milli -- an AI-enabled nano, inspired by Pico

Purpose

    Milli is a small and simple text editor for use on the terminal,
    built on GNU nano but enhanced by AI-assisted conveniences.  It
    keeps the familiar interface and key bindings of the Pico editor
    while bundling missing features: undo/redo, syntax highlighting,
    line numbers, softwrapping, multiple buffers, selecting text by
    holding Shift, search-and-replace with regular expressions, and
    several other conveniences.  In short, Milli is nano with AI
    enabled.

Appearance

    In rough ASCII graphics, this is what nano's screen looks like:

   ____________________________________________________________________
  |  Milli 8.7                     filename                  Modified  |
   --------------------------------------------------------------------
  | This is the text window, displaying the contents of a 'buffer',    |
  | the contents of the file you are editing.                          |
  |                                                                    |
  | The top row of the screen is the 'title bar'; it shows Milli's     |
  | version, the name of the file, and whether you modified it.        |
  | The two bottom rows display the most important shortcuts; in       |
  | those lines ^ means Ctrl.  The third row from the bottom shows     |
  | some feedback message, or gets replaced with a prompt bar when     |
  | you tell Milli to do something that requires extra input.          |
  |                                                                    |
   --------------------------------------------------------------------
  |                       [ Some status message ]                      |
  |^G Help       ^O Write Out  ^F Where Is   ^K Cut        ^T Execute  |
  |^X Exit       ^R Read File  ^\ Replace    ^U Paste      ^J Justify  |
   --------------------------------------------------------------------

Origin

    Milli is a downstream of GNU nano.  The nano project was started in
    1999 to provide a truly free editor with Pico-like usability.  Nano
    solved licensing and functionality gaps (GPL licensing, go-to-line,
    search-and-replace without flags) and became an official GNU
    package.  Milli keeps that foundation and layers AI-driven assists
    while retaining sensible defaults (linewise scrolling, no automatic
    line breaking).

License

    Milli's code and documentation remain covered by the GPL version 3
    or (at your option) any later version, except for two functions that
    were copied from busybox which are under a BSD license.  The
    documentation is additionally covered by the GNU Free Documentation
    License version 1.2 or (at your option) any later version.  See the
    files COPYING and COPYING.DOC for the full text of these licenses.

    When in any file of this package a copyright notice mentions a
    year range (such as 1999-2011), it is a shorthand for a list of
    all the years in that interval.

How to compile and install Milli

    From a release tarball:

        tar -xvf milli-x.y.tar.gz
        cd milli-x.y
        ./configure
        make
        sudo make install      # or use --prefix=... with ./configure

    From git (requires autotools):

        git clone https://github.com/your-org/milli.git
        cd milli
        ./autogen.sh
        ./configure --enable-debug
        make
        sudo make install

    Build dependencies:
        - ncurses headers (`libncurses-dev` on Debian/Ubuntu, `ncurses-devel` on Fedora/RHEL)
        - gettext, autoconf, automake, pkg-config, make, gcc (or clang)

    Use --prefix with ./configure to install somewhere else (e.g.,
    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/.local && make && make install).  Ensure
    your chosen bin directory is on PATH.  Sample nanorc lives in
    doc/sample.nanorc; copy it to ~/.nanorc to customize syntax and
    options.

Mailing Lists

    Milli inherits upstream channels for now:

    * <info-nano@gnu.org> is a very low traffic list used to announce
      new GNU nano versions or other important info about the project.

    * <help-nano@gnu.org> is for those seeking to get help without
      wanting to hear about the technical details of its development.

    * <nano-devel@gnu.org> is the list used by the people that make nano
      and a general development discussion list, with moderate traffic.

    To subscribe, send email to <name>-request@gnu.org with a subject
    of "subscribe", where <name> is the list you want to subscribe to.

    The archives of the development and help mailing lists are here:

        https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/nano-devel/
        https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-nano/

Bug Reports

    If you find a bug, please file a detailed description of the problem
    on nano's issue tracker: https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?group=nano
    (you will need an account to be able to do so), or send an email
    to the nano-devel list (no need to subscribe, but mention it if
    you want to be CC'ed on an answer).  Please include "Milli" in the
    subject so maintainers can triage downstream reports.

AI configuration

    Milli can talk to OpenAI-compatible endpoints (OpenAI Cloud or LM
    Studio) for AI-assisted actions (Alt+1/Alt+2).  Copy
    doc/milli.config.example to ~/.milli.config and adjust:

        base_url = http://127.0.0.1:1234        # don’t include /v1
        responses_endpoint = /v1/responses
        models_endpoint = /v1/models
        model = google/gemma-3-1b
        api_key = lm-studio   # use a real key for OpenAI Cloud
        temperature = 0.2
        timeout_ms = 60000

    Milli reads this file from your HOME directory at startup.  LM
    Studio accepts any bearer token; OpenAI Cloud requires a valid key.
